# Velero Assets

This folder contains logo images for Velero in gray (for light backgrounds) and white (for dark backgrounds like black t-shirts or dark mode!) – horizontal and stacked… in .eps and .svg.

## Some general guidelines for usage

• Don’t alter the logos/graphics: resize, reformat, recolor. Keep them intact.

• Don’t separate the word mark (Velero) from the icon) – we are still building a strong name and identity – and the logo by itself doesn’t have any strong recognition or association with as yet: so best practice keep the two together. Nike kept its name with the swoosh for quite some time before the swoosh became iconic.

• Don’t append the name to another brand – let it stand alone!

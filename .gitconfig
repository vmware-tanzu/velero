# Git configuration for containerized builds
# 
# This file fixes VCS stamping errors in Podman container environments.
# When Docker/Podman mounts the repository, the mount point directory
# (/github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero) is owned by root:root but the files
# inside are owned by the mapped user. This ownership mismatch triggers
# Git's "dubious ownership" security feature (introduced in Git 2.35.2+)
# which causes git operations to fail with exit code 128.
#
# The safe.directory configuration tells Git to trust this specific
# directory path, allowing VCS stamping and other git operations to
# work properly in containerized builds.
#
# See: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues/9004

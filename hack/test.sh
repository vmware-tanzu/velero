# After bumping up "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime" to v0.10.2, get the error "panic: mkdir /.cache/kubebuilder-envtest: permission denied"

# but the user and group don't exist inside the container, when the code(https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/blob/v0.10.2/pkg/internal/testing/addr/manager.go#L44)
# tries to get the cache directory, it gets the directory "/" and then get the permission error when trying to create directory under "/".

# This file can be used to explicitly map a release to a specific table-of-contents
# (TOC). You'll want to use this after any revamps to information architecture, to ensure
# that the navigation for older versions still work.
#
# Below is a commented out example of what this may look like:

# v0.9.0: old
# # v0.10.0 is unspecified, so it uses the toc under default.yml
# v0.11.0: default
# v0.12.0: default

master: v8-1-toc
v0.8.1: v8-1-toc
v0.8.0: v8-toc
v0.7.1: v7-1-toc
v0.7.0: v7-toc

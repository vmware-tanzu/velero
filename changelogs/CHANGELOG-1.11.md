### Highlights

#### BackupItemAction v2
This feature implements the BackupItemAction v2. BIA v2 has two new methods: Progress() and Cancel() and modifies the Execute() return value.

The API change is needed to facilitate long-running BackupItemAction plugin actions that may not be complete when the Execute() method returns. This will allow long-running BackupItemAction plugin actions to continue in the background while the Velero moves to the following plugin or the next item.

#### RestoreItemAction v2
This feature implemented the RestoreItemAction v2. RIA v2 has three new methods: Progress(), Cancel(), and AreAdditionalItemsReady(), and it modifies RestoreItemActionExecuteOutput() structure in the RIA return value.

The Progress() and Cancel() methods are needed to facilitate long-running RestoreItemAction plugin actions that may not be complete when the Execute() method returns. This will allow long-running RestoreItemAction plugin actions to continue in the background while the Velero moves to the following plugin or the next item. The AreAdditionalItemsReady() method is needed to allow plugins to tell Velero to wait until the returned additional items have been restored and are ready for use in the cluster before restoring the current item.

#### Plugin Progress Monitoring
This is intended as a replacement for the previously-approved Upload Progress Monitoring design ([Upload Progress Monitoring](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/blob/main/design/upload-progress.md)) to expand the supported use cases beyond snapshot upload to include what was previously called Async Backup/Restore Item Actions.

#### Flexible resource policy that can filter volumes to skip in the backup
This feature provides a flexible policy to filter volumes in the backup without requiring patching any labels or annotations to the pods or volumes. This policy is configured as k8s ConfigMap and maintained by the users themselves, and it can be extended to more scenarios in the future. By now, the policy rules out volumes from backup depending on the CSI driver, NFS setting, volume size, and StorageClass setting. Please refer to [policy API design](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/blob/main/design/Implemented/handle-backup-of-volumes-by-resources-filters.md#api-design)Â for the policy's ConifgMap format. It is not guaranteed to work on unofficial third-party plugins as it may not follow the existing backup workflow code logic of Velero.

#### Resource Filters that can distinguish cluster scope and namespace scope resources
This feature adds four new resource filters for backup. The new filters are separated into cluster scope and namespace scope. Before this feature, Velero could not filter cluster scope resources precisely. This feature provides the ability and refactors existing resource filter parameters.

#### Add a parameter for setting the Velero server connection with the k8s API server's timeout
In Velero, some code pieces need to communicate with the k8s API server. Before v1.11, these code pieces used hard-code timeout settings. This feature adds a resource-timeout parameter in the velero server binary to make it configurable.

#### Add resource list in the output of the restore describe command
Before this feature, Velero restore didn't have a restored resources list as the Velero backup. It's not convenient for users to learn what is restored. This feature adds the resources list and the handling result of the resources (including created, updated, failed, and skipped).

#### Refactor controllers with controller-runtime
In v1.11, Backup Controller and Restore controller are refactored with controller-runtime. Till v1.11, all Velero controllers use the controller-runtime framework.

#### Runtime and dependencies
To fix CVEs and keep pace with Golang, Velero made changes as follows:
* Bump Golang runtime to v1.19.8.
* Bump several dependent libraries to new versions.
* Compile Restic (v0.15.0) with Golang v1.19.8 instead of packaging the official binary.


### Breaking changes
* The Velero CSI plugin now determines whether to restore Volume's data from snapshots on the restore's restorePVs setting. Before v1.11, the CSI plugin doesn't check the restorePVs parameter setting. 


### Limitations/Known issues
* The Flexible resource policy that can filter volumes to skip in the backup is not guaranteed to work on unofficial third-party plugins because the plugins may not follow the existing backup workflow code logic of Velero. The ConfigMap used as the policy is supposed to be maintained by users.

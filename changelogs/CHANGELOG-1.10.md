### Highlights

#### Unified Repository and Kopia integration
In this release, we introduced the Unified Repository architecture to build a data path where data movers and the backup repository are decoupled and a unified backup repository could serve various data movement activities.

In this release, we also deeply integrate Velero with Kopia, specifically, Kopia's uploader modules are isolated as a generic file system uploader; Kopia's repository modules are encapsulated as the unified backup repository.

For more information, refer to the [design document](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/blob/v1.10.0/design/unified-repo-and-kopia-integration/unified-repo-and-kopia-integration.md).

#### File system backup refactor
Velero's file system backup (a.k.s. pod volume backup or formerly restic backup) is refactored as the first user of the Unified Repository architecture. Specifically, we added a new path, the Kopia path, besides the existing Restic path. While Restic path is still available and set as default, you can opt in Kopia path by specifying the `uploader-type` parameter at installation time. Meanwhile, you are free to restore from existing backups under either path, Velero dynamically switches to the correct path to process the restore.

Because of the new path, we renamed some modules and parameters, refer to the Break Changes section for more details.

For more information, visit the [file system backup document](https://velero.io/docs/v1.10/file-system-backup/) and [v1.10 upgrade guide document](https://velero.io/docs/v1.10/upgrade-to-1.10/).

Meanwhile, we've created a performance guide for both Restic path and Kopia path, which helps you to choose between the two paths and provides you the best practice to configure them under different scenarios. Please note that the results in the guide are based on our testing environments, you may get different results when testing in your own ones. For more information, visit the [performance guide document](https://velero.io/docs/v1.10/performance-guidance/).

#### Plugin versioning V1 refactor
In this release, Velero moves plugins BackupItemAction, RestoreItemAction and VolumeSnapshotterAction to version v1, this allows future plugin changes that do not support backward compatibility, so is a preparation for various complex tasks, for example, data movement tasks.
For more information, refer to the [plugin versioning design document](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/blob/v1.10.0/design/plugin-versioning.md).

#### Refactor the controllers using Kubebuilder v3
In this release we continued our code modernization work, rewriting some controllers using Kubebuilder v3. This work is ongoing and we will continue to make progress in future releases.

#### Add credentials to volume snapshot locations
In this release, we enabled dedicate credentials options to volume snapshot locations so that you can specify credentials per volume snapshot location as same as backup storage location.

For more information, please visit the [locations document](https://velero.io/docs/v1.10/locations/).

#### CSI snapshot enhancements
In this release we added several changes to enhance the robustness of CSI snapshot procedures, for example, some protection code for error handling, and a mechanism to skip exclusion checks so that CSI snapshot works with various backup resource filters.

#### Backup schedule pause/unpause
In this release, Velero supports to pause/unpause a backup schedule during or after its creation. Specifically:

At creation time, you can specify `â€“paused` flag to `velero schedule create` command, if so, you will create a paused schedule that will not run until it is unpaused
After creation, you can run `velero schedule pause` or `velero schedule unpause` command to pause/unpause a schedule

#### Runtime and dependencies
In order to fix CVEs, we changed Velero's runtime and dependencies as follows:

Bump go runtime to v1.18.8
Bump some core dependent libraries to newer versions
Compile Restic (v0.13.1) with go 1.18.8 instead of packaging the official binary


#### Breaking changes
Due to file system backup refactor, below modules and parameters name have been changed in this release:

`restic` daemonset is renamed to `node-agent`
`resticRepository` CR is renamed to `backupRepository`
`velero restic repo` command is renamed to `velero repo`
`velero-restic-credentials` secret is renamed to `velero-repo-credentials`
`default-volumes-to-restic` parameter is renamed to `default-volumes-to-fs-backup`
`restic-timeout` parameter is renamed to `fs-backup-timeout`
`default-restic-prune-frequency` parameter is renamed to `default-repo-maintain-frequency`

#### Upgrade
Due to the major changes of file system backup, the old upgrade steps are not suitable any more. For the new upgrade steps, visit [v1.10 upgrade guide document](https://velero.io/docs/v1.10/upgrade-to-1.10/).

#### Limitations/Known issues
In this release, Kopia backup repository (so the Kopia path of file system backup) doesn't support self signed certificate for S3 compatible storage. To track this problem, refer to this [Velero issue](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues/5123) or [Kopia issue](https://github.com/kopia/kopia/issues/1443). 

Due to the code change in Velero, there will be some code change required in vSphere plugin, without which the functionality may be impacted.  Therefore, if you are using vSphere plugin in your workflow, please hold the upgrade until the issue [#485](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-vsphere/issues/485) is fixed in vSphere plugin.

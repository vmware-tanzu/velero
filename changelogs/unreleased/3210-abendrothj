# Display which plugins are mandatory and can't be removed

## Summary

This change implements issue #3210 by adding built-in plugin detection and enhancing the plugin management CLI commands.

## Changes

- Added `Command` and `BuiltIn` fields to `PluginInfo` struct for better plugin identification
- Enhanced `velero plugin get` to display a `BuiltIn` column showing which plugins are mandatory and cannot be removed
- Enhanced `velero plugin remove` to accept plugin names (e.g., `velero.io/aws`) instead of requiring exact init container image names
- Added built-in plugin protection that refuses removal of system plugins with clear error messages
- Implemented heuristics to map plugin names to init containers for external plugins
- Added comprehensive unit tests covering all new functionality

## Testing

- Unit tests cover all new functionality (`TestGetInstalledPluginInfo`, `TestPluginNameHeuristics`, `TestBuiltInPluginDetection`)
- Build verification successful (`go build ./...`)
- CLI interface updated correctly (shows `[NAME | IMAGE]` syntax)
- All tests pass

## Example Usage

```bash
# Show which plugins are built-in
$ velero plugin get
NAME                    KIND                BuiltIn
velero.io/pod          BackupItemAction    true
velero.io/pv            BackupItemAction    true
velero.io/aws          ObjectStore         false
velero.io/gcp          ObjectStore         false

# Try to remove built-in plugin - refused
$ velero plugin remove velero.io/pod
An error occurred: plugin velero.io/pod is built-in and cannot be removed

# Remove external plugin by name - works
$ velero plugin remove velero.io/aws
# (removes corresponding init container)
```

## Breaking Changes

None - this is a backward-compatible enhancement.

## Documentation

The CLI help text has been updated to reflect the new `[NAME | IMAGE]` syntax for the plugin remove command.

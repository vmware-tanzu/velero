Fix Velero adding restore-wait init container when not needed

When restoring pods with volumes that were backed up using native datamover or CSI, 
Velero was unnecessarily adding the restore-wait init container. This container is 
only needed for file system restores. Now Velero checks if any volumes actually need 
file system restores and removes the init container if it's not needed, rather than 
just skipping its addition.

### Highlights

#### Resource Modifier Enhancement
Velero introduced the Resource Modifiers in v1.12.0. This feature allows users to specify a ConfigMap with a set of rules to modify the resources during restoration. However, only the JSON Patch is supported when creating the rules, and JSON Patch has some limitations, which cannot cover all use cases. In v1.13.0, Velero adds new support for JSON Merge Patch and Strategic Merge Patch, which provide more power and flexibility and allow users to use the same ConfigMap to apply patches on the resources. More design details can be found in [Support JSON Merge Patch and Strategic Merge Patch in Resource Modifiers](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/blob/main/design/Implemented/merge-patch-and-strategic-in-resource-modifier.md) design. For instructions on how to use the feature, please refer to the [Resource Modifiers](https://velero.io/docs/v1.13/restore-resource-modifiers/) doc.

#### Node-Agent Concurrency
Velero data movement activities from fs-backups and CSI snapshot data movements run in Velero node-agent, so may be hosted by every node in the cluster and consume resources (i.e. CPU, memory, network bandwidth) from there. With v1.13, users are allowed to configure how many data movement activities (a.k.a, loads) run in each node globally or by node, so that users can better leverage the performance of Velero data movement activities and the resource consumption in the cluster. For more information, check the [Node-Agent Concurrency](https://velero.io/docs/v1.13/node-agent-concurrency/) document. 

#### Parallel Files Upload Options
Velero now supports configurable options for parallel files upload when using Kopia uploader to do fs-backups or CSI snapshot data movements which makes speed up backup possible.
For more information, please check [Here](https://velero.io/docs/v1.13/backup-reference/#parallel-files-upload).

#### Write Sparse Files Options
If using fs-restore or CSI snapshot data movements, itâ€™s supported to write sparse files during restore. For more information, please check [Here](https://velero.io/docs/v1.13/restore-reference/#write-sparse-files).

#### Backup Describe
In v1.13, the Backup Volume section is added to the velero backup describe command output. The backup Volumes section describes information for all the volumes included in the backup of various backup types, i.e. native snapshot, fs-backup, CSI snapshot, and CSI snapshot data movement. Particularly, the velero backup description now supports showing the information of CSI snapshot data movements, which is not supported in v1.12.

Additionally, backup describe command will not check EnableCSI feature gate from client side, so if a backup has volumes with CSI snapshot or CSI snapshot data movement, backup describe command always shows the corresponding information in its output.

#### Backup's new VolumeInfo metadata
Create a new metadata file in the backup repository's backup name sub-directory to store the backup-including PVC and PV information. The information includes the backing-up method of the PVC and PV data, snapshot information, and status. The VolumeInfo metadata file determines how the PV resource should be restored. The Velero downstream software can also use this metadata file to get a summary of the backup's volume data information.

#### Enhancement for CSI Snapshot Data Movements when Velero Pod Restart
When performing backup and restore operations, enhancements have been implemented for Velero server pods or node agents to ensure that the current backup or restore process is not stuck or interrupted after restart due to certain exceptional circumstances.

#### New status fields added to show hook execution details
Hook execution status is now included in the backup/restore CR status and displayed in the backup/restore describe command output. Specifically, it will show the number of hooks which attempted to execute under the HooksAttempted  field and the number of hooks which failed to execute under the HooksFailed  field. 

#### AWS SDK Bump Up
Bump up AWS SDK for Go to version 2, which offers significant performance improvements in CPU and memory utilization over version 1.

#### Azure AD/Workload Identity Support
Azure AD/Workload Identity is the recommended approach to do the authentication with Azure services/AKS, Velero has introduced support for Azure AD/Workload Identity on the Velero Azure plugin side in previous releases, and in v1.13.0 Velero adds new support for Kopia operations(file system backup/data mover/etc.) with Azure AD/Workload Identity.

#### Runtime and dependencies
To fix CVEs and keep pace with Golang, Velero made changes as follows:
* Bump Golang runtime to v1.21.6.
* Bump several dependent libraries to new versions.
* Bump Kopia to v0.15.0.


### Breaking changes
* Backup describe command: due to the backup describe output enhancement, some existing information (i.e. the output for native snapshot, CSI snapshot, and fs-backup) has been moved to the Backup Volumes section with some format changes.
* API type changes: changes the field [DataMoverConfig](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/blob/v1.13.0/pkg/apis/velero/v2alpha1/data_upload_types.go#L54) in DataUploadSpec from `*map[string][string]`` to `map[string]string`
* Velero install command: due to the issue [#7264](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues/7264), v1.13.0 introduces a break change that make the informer cache enabled by default to keep the actual behavior consistent with the helper message(the informer cache is disabled by default before the change).


### Limitations/Known issues
* The backup's VolumeInfo metadata doesn't have the information updated in the async operations. This function could be supported in v1.14 release. 

### Note
* Velero introduces the informer cache which is enabled by default. The informer cache improves the restore performance but may cause higher memory consumption. Increase the memory limit of the Velero pod or disable the informer cache by specifying the `--disable-informer-cache` option when installing Velero if you get the OOM error.

### Deprecation announcement
* The generated k8s clients, informers, and listers are deprecated in the Velero v1.13 release. They are put in the Velero repository's pkg/generated directory. According to the n+2 supporting policy, the deprecated are kept for two more releases. The pkg/generated directory should be deleted in the v1.15 release.
* After the backup VolumeInfo metadata file is added to the backup, Velero decides how to restore the PV resource according to the VolumeInfo content. To support the backup generated by the older version of Velero, the old logic is also kept. The support for the backup without the VolumeInfo metadata file will be kept for two releases. The support logic will be deleted in the v1.15 release.

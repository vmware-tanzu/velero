The following example sets up the Velero server and client, then backs up and restores a sample application.

For simplicity, the example uses Minio, an S3-compatible storage service that runs locally on your cluster.
For additional functionality with this setup, see the section below on how to [expose Minio outside your cluster][1].

**NOTE** The example lets you explore basic Velero functionality. Configuring Minio for production is out of scope.

See [Set up Velero on your platform][3] for how to configure Velero for a production environment.

If you encounter issues with installing or configuring, see [Debugging Installation Issues](debugging-install.md).

### Prerequisites

* Access to a Kubernetes cluster, version 1.7 or later.  **Note:** restic support requires Kubernetes version 1.10 or later, or an earlier version with the mount propagation feature enabled. Restic support is not required for this example, but may be of interest later. See [Restic Integration][17].
* A DNS server on the cluster
* `kubectl` installed

### Download Velero

1. Download the [latest official release's](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/releases) tarball for your client platform.

    _We strongly recommend that you use an [official release](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/releases) of
Velero. The tarballs for each release contain the `velero` command-line client. The code in the main branch
of the Velero repository is under active development and is not guaranteed to be stable!_

1. Extract the tarball:

    ```bash
    tar -xvf <RELEASE-TARBALL-NAME>.tar.gz -C /dir/to/extract/to
    ```

    We'll refer to the directory you extracted to as the "Velero directory" in subsequent steps.

1. Move the `velero` binary from the Velero directory to somewhere in your PATH.

#### MacOS Installation

On Mac, you can use [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh) to install the `velero` client:

```bash
brew install velero
```

### Set up server

These instructions start the Velero server and a Minio instance that is accessible from within the cluster only. See [Expose Minio outside your cluster][31] for information about configuring your cluster for outside access to Minio. Outside access is required to access logs and run `velero describe` commands.

1. Create a Velero-specific credentials file (`credentials-velero`) in your local directory:

    ```
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = minio
    aws_secret_access_key = minio123
    ```

1. Start the server and the local storage service. In the Velero directory, run:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f examples/minio/00-minio-deployment.yaml
    ```
    ```
    velero install \
        --provider aws \
        --plugins velero/velero-plugin-for-aws:v1.0.0 \
        --bucket velero \
        --secret-file ./credentials-velero \
        --use-volume-snapshots=false \
        --backup-location-config region=minio,s3ForcePathStyle="true",s3Url=http://minio.velero.svc:9000
    ```

    This example assumes that it is running within a local cluster without a volume provider capable of snapshots, so no `VolumeSnapshotLocation` is created (`--use-volume-snapshots=false`).

    Additionally, you can specify `--use-restic` to enable restic support, and `--wait` to wait for the deployment to be ready.


1. Deploy the example nginx application:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f examples/nginx-app/base.yaml
    ```

1. Check to see that both the Velero and nginx deployments are successfully created:

    ```
    kubectl get deployments -l component=velero --namespace=velero
    kubectl get deployments --namespace=nginx-example
    ```

### Back up

1. Create a backup for any object that matches the `app=nginx` label selector:

    ```
    velero backup create nginx-backup --selector app=nginx
    ```

    Alternatively if you want to backup all objects *except* those matching the label `backup=ignore`:

    ```
    velero backup create nginx-backup --selector 'backup notin (ignore)'
    ```

1. (Optional) Create regularly scheduled backups based on a cron expression using the `app=nginx` label selector:

    ```
    velero schedule create nginx-daily --schedule="0 1 * * *" --selector app=nginx
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use some non-standard shorthand cron expressions:

    ```
    velero schedule create nginx-daily --schedule="@daily" --selector app=nginx
    ```

    See the [cron package's documentation][30] for more usage examples.

1. Simulate a disaster:

    ```
    kubectl delete namespace nginx-example
    ```

1. To check that the nginx deployment and service are gone, run:

    ```
    kubectl get deployments --namespace=nginx-example
    kubectl get services --namespace=nginx-example
    kubectl get namespace/nginx-example
    ```

    You should get no results.

    NOTE: You might need to wait for a few minutes for the namespace to be fully cleaned up.

### Restore

1. Run:

    ```
    velero restore create --from-backup nginx-backup
    ```

1. Run:

    ```
    velero restore get
    ```

    After the restore finishes, the output looks like the following:

    ```
    NAME                          BACKUP         STATUS      WARNINGS   ERRORS    CREATED                         SELECTOR
    nginx-backup-20170727200524   nginx-backup   Completed   0          0         2017-07-27 20:05:24 +0000 UTC   <none>
    ```

NOTE: The restore can take a few moments to finish. During this time, the `STATUS` column reads `InProgress`.

After a successful restore, the `STATUS` column is `Completed`, and `WARNINGS` and `ERRORS` are 0. All objects in the `nginx-example` namespace should be just as they were before you deleted them.

If there are errors or warnings, you can look at them in detail:

```
velero restore describe <RESTORE_NAME>
```

For more information, see [the debugging information][18].

### Clean up

If you want to delete any backups you created, including data in object storage and persistent
volume snapshots, you can run:

```
velero backup delete BACKUP_NAME
```

This asks the Velero server to delete all backup data associated with `BACKUP_NAME`.  You need to do
this for each backup you want to permanently delete. A future version of Velero will allow you to
delete multiple backups by name or label selector.

Once fully removed, the backup is no longer visible when you run:

```
velero backup get BACKUP_NAME
```

To completely uninstall Velero, minio, and the nginx example app from your Kubernetes cluster:

```
kubectl delete namespace/velero clusterrolebinding/velero
kubectl delete crds -l component=velero
kubectl delete -f examples/nginx-app/base.yaml
```

## Expose Minio outside your cluster with a Service

When you run commands to get logs or describe a backup, the Velero server generates a pre-signed URL to download the requested items. To access these URLs from outside the cluster -- that is, from your Velero client -- you need to make Minio available outside the cluster. You can:

- Change the Minio Service type from `ClusterIP` to `NodePort`.
- Set up Ingress for your cluster, keeping Minio Service type `ClusterIP`.

You can also specify a `publicUrl` config field for the pre-signed URL in your backup storage location config.

### Expose Minio with Service of type NodePort

The Minio deployment by default specifies a Service of type `ClusterIP`. You can change this to `NodePort` to easily expose a cluster service externally if you can reach the node from your Velero client.

You must also get the Minio URL, which you can then specify as the value of the `publicUrl` field in your backup storage location config.

1.  In `examples/minio/00-minio-deployment.yaml`, change the value of Service `spec.type` from `ClusterIP` to `NodePort`.

1.  Get the Minio URL:

  - if you're running Minikube:

      ```shell
      minikube service minio --namespace=velero --url
      ```

  - in any other environment:
    1.  Get the value of an external IP address or DNS name of any node in your cluster. You must be able to reach this address from the Velero client.
    1.  Append the value of the NodePort to get a complete URL. You can get this value by running:

        ```shell
        kubectl -n velero get svc/minio -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}'
        ```

1.  Edit your `BackupStorageLocation` YAML, adding `publicUrl: <URL_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP>` as a field under `spec.config`. You must include the `http://` or `https://` prefix.

## Accessing logs with an HTTPS endpoint

If you're using Minio with HTTPS, you may see unintelligible text in the output of `velero describe`, or `velero logs` commands.

In order to fix this, you can add a public URL to the `BackupStorageLocation`.

In a terminal, run the following:

```shell
kubectl patch -n velero backupstoragelocation default --type merge -p '{"spec":{"config":{"publicUrl":"https://<a public IP for your Minio instance>:9000"}}}'
```

Note that Velero does not support custom, self-signed certificates prior to v1.4.0.

## Expose Minio outside your cluster with Kubernetes in Docker (KinD):

Kubernetes in Docker currently does not have support for NodePort services (see [this issue](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/99)). In this case, you can use a port forward to access the Minio bucket.

In a terminal, run the following:

```shell
MINIO_POD=$(kubectl get pods -n velero -l component=minio -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

kubectl port-forward $MINIO_POD -n velero 9000:9000
```

Then, in another terminal:

```shell
kubectl edit backupstoragelocation default -n velero
```

Add `publicUrl: http://localhost:9000` under the `spec.config` section.

### Work with Ingress

Configuring Ingress for your cluster is out of scope for the Velero documentation. If you have already set up Ingress, however, it makes sense to continue with it while you run the example Velero configuration with Minio.

In this case:

1.  Keep the Service type as `ClusterIP`.

1.  Edit your `BackupStorageLocation` YAML, adding `publicUrl: <URL_AND_PORT_OF_INGRESS>` as a field under `spec.config`.

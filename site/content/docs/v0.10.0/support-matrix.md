Ark supports a variety of storage providers for different backup and snapshot operations. As of version 0.6.0, a plugin system allows anyone to add compatibility for additional backup and volume storage platforms without modifying the Ark codebase.

## Backup Storage Providers

| Provider                  | Owner    | Contact                         |
|---------------------------|----------|---------------------------------|
| [AWS S3][2]               | Ark Team | [Slack][10], [GitHub Issue][11] |
| [Azure Blob Storage][3]   | Ark Team | [Slack][10], [GitHub Issue][11] |
| [Google Cloud Storage][4] | Ark Team | [Slack][10], [GitHub Issue][11] |

## S3-Compatible Backup Storage Providers

Ark uses [Amazon's Go SDK][12] to connect to the S3 API. Some third-party storage providers also support the S3 API, and users have reported the following providers work with Ark:

_Note that these providers are not regularly tested by the Ark team._

 * [IBM Cloud][5]
 * [Minio][9]
 * Ceph RADOS v12.2.7
 * [DigitalOcean][7]

## Volume Snapshot Providers

### Adding a new plugin

To write a plugin for a new backup or volume storage system, take a look at the [example repo][8].

After you publish your plugin, open a PR that adds your plugin to the appropriate list.

title: "File System Backup"
layout: docs
---

Velero supports backing up and restoring Kubernetes volumes attached to pods from the file system of the volumes, called 
File System Backup (FSB shortly) or Pod Volume Backup. The data movement is fulfilled by using modules from free open-source 
backup tools [restic][1] and [kopia][2]. This support is considered beta quality. Please see the list of [limitations](#limitations) 
to understand if it fits your use case.  

Velero allows you to take snapshots of persistent volumes as part of your backups if you’re using one of
the supported cloud providers’ block storage offerings (Amazon EBS Volumes, Azure Managed Disks, Google Persistent Disks).
It also provides a plugin model that enables anyone to implement additional object and block storage backends, outside the
main Velero repository.  

If your storage supports CSI (Container Storage Interface) snapshots, Velero also allows you to take snapshots through CSI and then optionally move the snapshot data to a different storage location.  

Velero's File System Backup is an addition to the aforementioned snapshot approaches. Its pros and cons are listed below:  
Pros:  
- It is capable of backing up and restoring almost any type of Kubernetes volume. Therefore, if you need a volume snapshot 
plugin for your storage platform, or if you're using EFS, AzureFile, NFS, emptyDir, local, or any other volume type that doesn't 
have a native snapshot concept, FSB might be for you.  
- It is not tied to a specific storage platform, so you could save the backup data to a different storage platform from 
the one backing Kubernetes volumes, for example, a durable storage.

Cons:
- It backs up data from the live file system, in which way the data is not captured at the same point in time, so is less consistent than the snapshot approaches.
- It access the file system from the mounted hostpath directory, so Velero Node Agent pods need to run as root user and even under privileged mode in some environments.

## Relationship with Volume Snapshots

It's important to understand that File System Backup (FSB) and volume snapshots (native/CSI) are **mutually exclusive** for the same volume:

- When FSB is performed on a volume, Velero will **skip** taking a snapshot of that volume
- When FSB is opted out for a volume, Velero will **attempt** to take a snapshot (if configured)
- This prevents duplicate backups of the same data

This behavior is automatic and ensures optimal backup performance and storage usage.  

**NOTE:** hostPath volumes are not supported, but the [local volume type][5] is supported.  
**NOTE:** restic is under the deprecation process by following [Velero Deprecation Policy][17], for more details, see the Restic Deprecation section.

## Setup File System Backup

### Prerequisites

- Understand how Velero performs [file system backup](#how-backup-and-restore-work).
- [Download][4] the latest Velero release.
- Kubernetes v1.16.0 or later are required. Velero's File System Backup requires the Kubernetes [MountPropagation feature][6].

### Install Velero Node Agent

Velero Node Agent is a Kubernetes daemonset that hosts controllers for File System Backup.  
To install Node Agent, use the `--use-node-agent` flag in the `velero install` command. See the [install overview][3] for more 
details on other flags for the install command.  

```
velero install --use-node-agent
```

When using FSB on a storage that doesn't have Velero support for snapshots, the `--use-volume-snapshots=false` flag prevents an 
unused `VolumeSnapshotLocation` from being created on installation.  

At present, Velero FSB supports object storage as the backup storage only. Velero gets the parameters from the 
[BackupStorageLocation `config`](api-types/backupstoragelocation.md) to compose the URL to the backup storage. Velero's known object 
storage providers are include here [supported providers](supported-providers.md), for which, Velero pre-defines the endpoints; if you 
want to use a different backup storage, make sure it is S3 compatible and you provide the correct bucket name and endpoint in 
BackupStorageLocation. Velero handles the creation of the backup repo prefix in the backup storage, so make sure it is specified in BackupStorageLocation correctly.  

Velero creates one backup repo per namespace. For example, if backing up 2 namespaces, namespace1 and namespace2, using kopia 
repository on AWS S3, the full backup repo path for namespace1 would be `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bucket/kopia/ns1` and 
for namespace2 would be `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bucket/kopia/ns2`.  

There may be additional installation steps depending on the cloud provider plugin you are using. You should refer to the 
[plugin specific documentation](supported-providers.md) for the most up to date information.  

**Note:** Currently, Velero creates a secret named `velero-repo-credentials` in the velero install namespace, containing a default backup repository password.
You can update the secret with your own password encoded as base64 prior to the first backup (i.e., FS Backup, data mover) targeting to the backup repository. The value of the key to update is
```
data:
  repository-password: <custom-password>
```
Backup repository is created during the first execution of backup targeting to it after installing Velero with node agent. If you update the secret password after the first
backup which created the backup repository, then Velero will not be able to connect with the older backups.

### Configure Node Agent DaemonSet spec

After installation, some PaaS/CaaS platforms based on Kubernetes also require modifications the node-agent DaemonSet spec. 
The steps in this section are only needed if you are installing on RancherOS, k0s, Nutanix, OpenShift, VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid 
Integrated Edition (formerly VMware Enterprise PKS), or Microsoft Azure.  


**RancherOS**


Update the host path for volumes in the node-agent DaemonSet in the Velero namespace from `/var/lib/kubelet/pods` to 
`/opt/rke/var/lib/kubelet/pods`.  

```yaml
hostPath:
  path: /var/lib/kubelet/pods
```

to

```yaml
hostPath:
  path: /opt/rke/var/lib/kubelet/pods
```


**k0s**


Update the host path for volumes in the node-agent DaemonSet in the Velero namespace from `/var/lib/kubelet/pods` to 
`/var/lib/k0s/kubelet/pods/`.  

```yaml
hostPath:
  path: /var/lib/kubelet/pods
```

to

```yaml
hostPath:
  path: /var/lib/k0s/kubelet/pods/
```

**Nutanix**


Update the host path for volumes in the node-agent DaemonSet in the Velero namespace from `/var/lib/kubelet/pods` to
`/var/nutanix/var/lib/kubelet`.

```yaml
hostPath:
  path: /var/lib/kubelet/pods
```

to

```yaml
hostPath:
  path: /var/nutanix/var/lib/kubelet
```

**OpenShift**


To mount the correct hostpath to pods volumes, run the node-agent pod in `privileged` mode.

1. Add the `velero` ServiceAccount to the `privileged` SCC:

    ```
    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z velero -n velero
    ```

2. Install Velero with the '--privileged-node-agent' option to request a privileged mode:
  
    ```
    velero install --use-node-agent --privileged-node-agent
    ```


If node-agent is not running in a privileged mode, it will not be able to access pods volumes within the mounted 
hostpath directory because of the default enforced SELinux mode configured in the host system level. You can 
[create a custom SCC](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html) to relax the 
security in your cluster so that node-agent pods are allowed to use the hostPath volume plugin without granting 
them access to the `privileged` SCC.  

By default a userland openshift namespace will not schedule pods on all nodes in the cluster.  

To schedule on all nodes the namespace needs an annotation:  

```
oc annotate namespace <velero namespace> openshift.io/node-selector=""
```

This should be done before velero installation.  

Or the ds needs to be deleted and recreated:  

```
oc get ds node-agent -o yaml -n <velero namespace> > ds.yaml
oc annotate namespace <velero namespace> openshift.io/node-selector=""
oc create -n <velero namespace> -f ds.yaml
```

**VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (formerly VMware Enterprise PKS)**  

You need to enable the `Allow Privileged` option in your plan configuration so that Velero is able to mount the hostpath.  

The hostPath should be changed from `/var/lib/kubelet/pods` to `/var/vcap/data/kubelet/pods`

```yaml
hostPath:
  path: /var/vcap/data/kubelet/pods
```

## To back up

Velero supports two approaches of discovering pod volumes that need to be backed up using FSB:  

- Opt-in approach: Where every pod containing a volume to be backed up using FSB must be annotated 
with the volume's name.
- Opt-out approach: Where all pod volumes are backed up using FSB, with the ability to opt-out any 
volumes that should not be backed up.

The following sections provide more details on the two approaches.  

### Using the opt-out approach

In this approach, Velero will back up all pod volumes using FSB with the exception of:  

- Volumes mounting the default service account token, Kubernetes Secrets, and ConfigMaps
- Hostpath volumes
- **Volumes explicitly excluded using annotations** (see below)

**Important:** When you exclude a volume from FSB using annotations, Velero will attempt to back it up using volume snapshots instead (if CSI snapshots are enabled and the volume is a CSI volume or if properly configured with a compatible VolumeSnapshotLocation).

It is possible to exclude volumes from being backed up using the `backup.velero.io/backup-volumes-excludes` 
annotation on the pod.  

Instructions to back up using this approach are as follows:  

1. Run the following command on each pod that contains volumes that should **not** be backed up using FSB

    ```bash
    kubectl -n YOUR_POD_NAMESPACE annotate pod/YOUR_POD_NAME backup.velero.io/backup-volumes-excludes=YOUR_VOLUME_NAME_1,YOUR_VOLUME_NAME_2,...
    ```
    where the volume names are the names of the volumes in the pod spec.

    For example, in the following pod:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: app1
      namespace: sample
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver
        name: test-webserver
        volumeMounts:
        - name: pvc1-vm
          mountPath: /volume-1
        - name: pvc2-vm
          mountPath: /volume-2
      volumes:
      - name: pvc1-vm
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: pvc1
      - name: pvc2-vm
          claimName: pvc2
    ```
    to exclude FSB of volume `pvc1-vm`, you would run:

    ```bash
    kubectl -n sample annotate pod/app1 backup.velero.io/backup-volumes-excludes=pvc1-vm
    ```

2. Take a Velero backup:

    ```bash
    velero backup create BACKUP_NAME --default-volumes-to-fs-backup OTHER_OPTIONS
    ```

    The above steps uses the opt-out approach on a per backup basis.

    Alternatively, this behavior may be enabled on all velero backups running the `velero install` command with 
    the `--default-volumes-to-fs-backup` flag. Refer [install overview][10] for details.  

3. When the backup completes, view information about the backups:

    ```bash
    velero backup describe YOUR_BACKUP_NAME
    ```
    ```bash
    kubectl -n velero get podvolumebackups -l velero.io/backup-name=YOUR_BACKUP_NAME -o yaml
    ```

### Using opt-in pod volume backup

Velero, by default, uses this approach to discover pod volumes that need to be backed up using FSB. Every pod 
containing a volume to be backed up using FSB must be annotated with the volume's name using the 
`backup.velero.io/backup-volumes` annotation.

**Note:** Volumes not annotated for FSB will be considered for volume snapshots if:
- `--snapshot-volumes` is not set to `false`
- The volume supports snapshots (either CSI or native)
- Either the volume is a CSI volume and CSI snapshots are enabled or there is a compatible VolumeSnapshotLocation configured  

Instructions to back up using this approach are as follows:

1. Run the following for each pod that contains a volume to back up:

    ```bash
    kubectl -n YOUR_POD_NAMESPACE annotate pod/YOUR_POD_NAME backup.velero.io/backup-volumes=YOUR_VOLUME_NAME_1,YOUR_VOLUME_NAME_2,...
    ```

    where the volume names are the names of the volumes in the pod spec.

    For example, for the following pod:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: sample
      namespace: foo
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver
        name: test-webserver
        volumeMounts:
        - name: pvc-volume
          mountPath: /volume-1
        - name: emptydir-volume
          mountPath: /volume-2
      volumes:
      - name: pvc-volume
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: test-volume-claim
      - name: emptydir-volume
        emptyDir: {}
    ```

    You'd run:

    ```bash
    kubectl -n foo annotate pod/sample backup.velero.io/backup-volumes=pvc-volume,emptydir-volume
    ```

    This annotation can also be provided in a pod template spec if you use a controller to manage your pods.  

1. Take a Velero backup:

    ```bash
    velero backup create NAME OPTIONS...
    ```

1. When the backup completes, view information about the backups:

    ```bash
    velero backup describe YOUR_BACKUP_NAME
    ```
    ```bash
    kubectl -n velero get podvolumebackups -l velero.io/backup-name=YOUR_BACKUP_NAME -o yaml
    ```

## To restore

Regardless of how volumes are discovered for backup using FSB, the process of restoring remains the same.  

1. Restore from your Velero backup:

    ```bash
    velero restore create --from-backup BACKUP_NAME OPTIONS...
    ```

1. When the restore completes, view information about your pod volume restores:

    ```bash
    velero restore describe YOUR_RESTORE_NAME
    ```
    ```bash
    kubectl -n velero get podvolumerestores -l velero.io/restore-name=YOUR_RESTORE_NAME -o yaml
    ```

## Limitations

- `hostPath` volumes are not supported. [Local persistent volumes][5] are supported.
- At present, Velero uses a static, common encryption key for all backup repositories it creates. **This means 
that anyone who has access to your backup storage can decrypt your backup data**. Make sure that you limit access 
to the backup storage appropriately.
- An incremental backup chain will be maintained across pod reschedules for PVCs. However, for pod volumes that 
are *not* PVCs, such as `emptyDir` volumes, when a pod is deleted/recreated (for example, by a ReplicaSet/Deployment), 
the next backup of those volumes will be full rather than incremental, because the pod volume's lifecycle is assumed 
to be defined by its pod.
- Even though the backup data could be incrementally preserved, for a single file data, FSB leverages on deduplication 
to find the difference to be saved. This means that large files (such as ones storing a database) will take a long time 
to scan for data deduplication, even if the actual difference is small.
- Velero's File System Backup reads/writes data from volumes by accessing the node's filesystem, on which the pod is running. 
For this reason, FSB can only backup volumes that are mounted by a pod and not directly from the PVC. For orphan PVC/PV pairs 
(without running pods), some Velero users overcame this limitation running a staging pod (i.e. a busybox or alpine container 
with an infinite sleep) to mount these PVC/PV pairs prior taking a Velero backup.  
- Velero File System Backup expects volumes to be mounted under `<hostPath>/<pod UID>` (`hostPath` is configurable as mentioned in [Configure Node Agent DaemonSet spec](#configure-node-agent-daemonset-spec)). Some Kubernetes systems (i.e., [vCluster][11]) don't mount volumes under the `<pod UID>` sub-dir, Velero File System Backup is not working with them.  
- File system restores of the same pod won't start until all the volumes of the pod get bound, even though some of the volumes have been bound and ready for restore. An a result, if a pod has multiple volumes, while only part of the volumes are restored by file system restore, these file system restores won't start until the other volumes are restored completely by other restore types (i.e., [CSI Snapshot Restore][12], [CSI Snapshot Data Movement][13]), the file system restores won't happen concurrently with those other types of restores.  

## Customize Restore Helper Container

Velero uses a helper init container when performing a FSB restore. By default, the image for this container is same with the Velero server container. 
You can customize the image that is used for this helper by creating a ConfigMap in the Velero namespace with the alternate image.  

In addition, you can customize the resource requirements for the init container, should you need.  

The ConfigMap must look like the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  # any name can be used; Velero uses the labels (below)
  # to identify it rather than the name
  name: fs-restore-action-config
  # must be in the velero namespace
  namespace: velero
  # the below labels should be used verbatim in your
  # ConfigMap.
  labels:
    # this value-less label identifies the ConfigMap as
    # config for a plugin (i.e. the built-in restore
    # item action plugin)
    velero.io/plugin-config: ""
    # this label identifies the name and kind of plugin
    # that this ConfigMap is for.
    velero.io/pod-volume-restore: RestoreItemAction
data:
  # The value for "image" can either include a tag or not;
  # if the tag is *not* included, the tag from the main Velero
  # image will automatically be used.
  image: myregistry.io/my-custom-helper-image[:OPTIONAL_TAG]

  # "cpuRequest" sets the request.cpu value on the restore init containers during restore.
  # If not set, it will default to "100m". A value of "0" is treated as unbounded.
  cpuRequest: 200m

  # "memRequest" sets the request.memory value on the restore init containers during restore.
  # If not set, it will default to "128Mi". A value of "0" is treated as unbounded.
  memRequest: 128Mi

  # "cpuLimit" sets the request.cpu value on the restore init containers during restore.
  # If not set, it will default to "100m". A value of "0" is treated as unbounded.
  cpuLimit: 200m

  # "memLimit" sets the request.memory value on the restore init containers during restore.
  # If not set, it will default to "128Mi". A value of "0" is treated as unbounded.
  memLimit: 128Mi

  # "secCtxRunAsUser" sets the securityContext.runAsUser value on the restore init containers during restore.
  secCtxRunAsUser: 1001

  # "secCtxRunAsGroup" sets the securityContext.runAsGroup value on the restore init containers during restore.
  secCtxRunAsGroup: 999

  # "secCtxAllowPrivilegeEscalation" sets the securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation value on the restore init containers during restore.
  secCtxAllowPrivilegeEscalation: false

  # "secCtx" sets the securityContext object value on the restore init containers during restore.
  # This key override  `secCtxRunAsUser`, `secCtxRunAsGroup`, `secCtxAllowPrivilegeEscalation` if `secCtx.runAsUser`, `secCtx.runAsGroup` or `secCtx.allowPrivilegeEscalation` are set.
  secCtx: |
    capabilities:
      drop:
      - ALL
      add: []
    allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
    runAsUser: 1001
    runAsGroup: 999

```

## Troubleshooting

Run the following checks:

Are your Velero server and daemonset pods running?

```bash
kubectl get pods -n velero
```

Does your backup repository exist, and is it ready?

```bash
velero repo get

velero repo get REPO_NAME -o yaml
```

Are there any errors in your Velero backup/restore?

```bash
velero backup describe BACKUP_NAME
velero backup logs BACKUP_NAME

velero restore describe RESTORE_NAME
velero restore logs RESTORE_NAME
```

What is the status of your pod volume backups/restores?

```bash
kubectl -n velero get podvolumebackups -l velero.io/backup-name=BACKUP_NAME -o yaml

kubectl -n velero get podvolumerestores -l velero.io/restore-name=RESTORE_NAME -o yaml
```

Is there any useful information in the Velero server or daemon pod logs?

```bash
kubectl -n velero logs deploy/velero
kubectl -n velero logs DAEMON_POD_NAME
```

**NOTE**: You can increase the verbosity of the pod logs by adding `--log-level=debug` as an argument
to the container command in the deployment/daemonset pod template spec.

### Verifying backup methods used

To understand which backup method was used for your volumes:

1. Check if volumes were skipped for FSB:
   ```bash
   velero backup logs BACKUP_NAME | grep "skipped PVs"
   ```
   This will show volumes opted out of FSB, which may still be backed up via snapshots.

2. Verify volume snapshots were created:
   ```bash
   velero backup describe BACKUP_NAME --details
   ```
   Look for the "Velero-Native Snapshots" or "CSI Snapshots" sections.

3. Check PodVolumeBackups for FSB:
   ```bash
   kubectl -n velero get podvolumebackups -l velero.io/backup-name=BACKUP_NAME
   ```

**Note:** A volume appearing in the "skipped PVs" summary doesn't mean it wasn't backed up - it may have been backed up via volume snapshot instead.

## Backup Method Decision Flow

When Velero encounters a volume during backup, it follows this decision flow:

1. **Is the volume opted out of FSB?** (via `backup.velero.io/backup-volumes-excludes`)
   - Yes → Skip FSB, attempt volume snapshot (if configured)
   - No → Continue to step 2

2. **Is the volume opted in for FSB?** (via `backup.velero.io/backup-volumes` or `--default-volumes-to-fs-backup`)
   - Yes → Perform FSB, skip volume snapshot
   - No → Attempt volume snapshot (if configured)

3. **For volume snapshots to succeed:**
   - CSI snapshots must be enabled for CSI volumes or compatible VolumeSnapshotLocation must be configured
   - Volume type must be supported by the snapshot provider
   - `--snapshot-volumes` must not be `false`

## How backup and restore work

### How Velero integrates with Kopia
Velero integrate Kopia modules into Velero's code, primarily two modules:
- Kopia Uploader: Velero makes some wrap and isolation around it to create a generic file system uploader, 
which is used to backup pod volume data
- Kopia Repository: Velero integrates it with Velero's Unified Repository Interface, it is used to preserve the backup data and manage 
the backup storage  

For more details, refer to [kopia architecture](https://kopia.io/docs/advanced/architecture/) and 
Velero's [Unified Repository & Kopia Integration Design](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/blob/main/design/Implemented/unified-repo-and-kopia-integration/unified-repo-and-kopia-integration.md)

### Custom resource and controllers
Velero has three custom resource definitions and associated controllers:

- `BackupRepository` - represents/manages the lifecycle of Velero's backup repositories. Velero creates 
a backup repository per namespace when the first FSB backup/restore for a namespace is requested. The backup 
repository is backed by kopia, the `BackupRepository` controller invokes kopia internally, 
refer to [kopia integration](#how-velero-integrates-with-kopia) for details.

You can see information about your Velero's backup repositories by running `velero repo get`.

- `PodVolumeBackup` - represents a FSB backup of a volume in a pod. The main Velero backup process creates
one or more of these when it finds an annotated pod. Each node in the cluster runs a controller for this
resource (in a daemonset) that handles the `PodVolumeBackups` for pods on that node. `PodVolumeBackup` is backed by kopia, 
the data mover pod invokes kopia internally, refer to [kopia integration](#how-velero-integrates-with-kopia) for details.

- `PodVolumeRestore` - represents a FSB restore of a pod volume. The main Velero restore process creates one
or more of these when it encounters a pod that has associated FSB backups. Each node in the cluster runs a
controller for this resource (in the same daemonset as above) that handles the `PodVolumeRestores` for pods
on that node. `PodVolumeRestore` is backed by kopia, the controller or data mover pod invokes kopia internally, 
refer to [kopia integration](#how-velero-integrates-with-kopia) for details.  

### Backup

1. Based on configuration, the main Velero backup process uses the opt-in or opt-out approach to check each pod 
that it's backing up for the volumes to be backed up using FSB.  
2. When found, Velero first ensures a backup repository exists for the pod's namespace, by:
    - checking if a `BackupRepository` custom resource already exists
    - if not, creating a new one, and waiting for the `BackupRepository` controller to init/connect it
3. Velero then creates a `PodVolumeBackup` custom resource per volume listed in the pod annotation  
4. The main Velero process now waits for the `PodVolumeBackup` resources to complete or fail  
5. Meanwhile, each `PodVolumeBackup` is handled by the controller on the appropriate node, which:
    - has a hostPath volume mount of `/var/lib/kubelet/pods` to access the pod volume data
    - finds the pod volume's subdirectory within the above volume
    - creates a data mover pod which mounts the pod volume's subdirectory as a host path
    - waits the data mover pod until it reaches to a terminal state
    - updates the status of the custom resource to `Completed` or `Failed`
6. Kopia modules are launched inside the data mover pod and back up data from the host path mount
7. As each `PodVolumeBackup` finishes, the main Velero process adds it to the Velero backup in a file named 
`<backup-name>-podvolumebackups.json.gz`. This file gets uploaded to object storage alongside the backup tarball. 
It will be used for restores, as seen in the next section.  

### Restore

1. The main Velero restore process checks each existing `PodVolumeBackup` custom resource in the cluster to backup from.  
2. For each `PodVolumeBackup` found, Velero first ensures a backup repository exists for the pod's namespace, by:
    - checking if a `BackupRepository` custom resource already exists
    - if not, creating a new one, and waiting for the `BackupRepository` controller to connect it (note that
    in this case, the actual repository should already exist in backup storage, so the Velero controller will simply
    check it for integrity and make a location connection)
3. Velero adds an init container to the pod, whose job is to wait for all FSB restores for the pod to complete (more
on this shortly)
4. Velero creates the pod, with the added init container, by submitting it to the Kubernetes API. Then, the Kubernetes 
scheduler schedules this pod to a worker node. If the pod fails to be scheduled for 
some reason (i.e. lack of cluster resources), the FSB restore will not be done.
5. Velero creates a `PodVolumeRestore` custom resource for each volume to be restored in the pod
6. The main Velero process now waits for each `PodVolumeRestore` resource to complete or fail
7. Meanwhile, each `PodVolumeRestore` is handled by the controller on the appropriate node, which:
    - has a hostPath volume mount of `/var/lib/kubelet/pods` to access the pod volume data
    - waits for the pod to be running the init container
    - finds the pod volume's subdirectory within the above volume
    - launches kopia modules inside the node-agent pod to run the restore
    - creates a data mover pod which mounts the pod volume's subdirectory as a host path and wait until it reaches to a terminal state
    - on success, writes a file into the pod volume, in a `.velero` subdirectory, whose name is the UID of the Velero 
    restore that this pod volume restore is for
    - updates the status of the custom resource to `Completed` or `Failed`
8. Kopia modules are launched inside the data mover pod and restore data to the host path mount
9. The init container that was added to the pod is running a process that waits until it finds a file
within each restored volume, under `.velero`, whose name is the UID of the Velero restore being run
10. Once all such files are found, the init container's process terminates successfully and the pod moves
on to running other init containers/the main containers.

Velero won't restore a resource if a that resource is scaled to 0 and already exists in the cluster. If Velero restored the 
requested pods in this scenario, the Kubernetes reconciliation loops that manage resources would delete the running pods 
because its scaled to be 0. Velero will be able to restore once the resources is scaled up, and the pods are created and remain running.  

### Backup Deletion
When a backup is created, a snapshot is saved into the repository for the volume data under the both path. The snapshot is a reference to the volume data saved in the repository.  
When deleting a backup, Velero calls the repository to delete the repository snapshot. So the repository snapshot disappears immediately after the backup is deleted. Then the volume data backed up in the repository turns to orphan, but it is not deleted by this time. The repository relies on the maintenance functionalitiy to delete the orphan data.  
As a result, after you delete a backup, you don't see the backup storage size reduces until some full maintenance jobs completes successfully. And for the same reason, you should check and make sure that the periodical repository maintenance job runs and completes successfully.  

Even after deleting all the backups and their backup data (by repository maintenance), the backup storage is still not empty, some repository metadata are there to keep the instance of the backup repository.  
Furthermore, Velero never deletes these repository metadata, if you are sure you'll never usage the backup repository, you can empty the backup storage manually.   

Kopia uploader may keep some internal snapshots which is not managed by Velero. In normal cases, the internal snapshots are deleted along with running of backups.  
However, if you run a backup which aborts halfway(some internal snapshots are thereby generated) and never run new backups again, some internal snapshots may be left there. In this case, since you stop using the backup repository, you can delete the entire repository metadata from the backup storage manually.  

### Parallelism
By default, one `PodVolumeBackup`/`PodVolumeRestore` request is handled in a node at a time. You can configure more parallelism per node by [node-agent Concurrency Configuration][19].  
By the meantime, one data mover pod is created for each volume to be backed up/restored, if there is no available concurrency quota, the data mover pod has to wait there. To make a control of the data mover pods, you can configure the [node-agent Prepare Queue Length][20].  

For each volume, files in the volume are processed in parallel. You can use `--parallel-files-upload` backup flag or `--parallel-files-download` restore flag to control how many files are processed in parallel. Otherwise, if they are not set, Velero by default refers to the number of CPU cores in the node (where the backup/restore is running) for the parallelism. That is to say, the parallelism is not affected by the CPU request/limit set to the data mover pods.  

Notice that Golang 1.25 and later respects the CPU limit set to the pods to decide the physical threads provisioned to the pod processes (see [Container-aware GOMAXPROCS][23] for more details), so for Velero 1.18 (which consumes Golang 1.25) and later, if you set a CPU limit to the data mover pods, you may not get the expected performance (e.g., backup/restore throughput) with the default parallelism. The outcome may or may not be obvious varying on your volume data. If it is required, you could customize `--parallel-files-upload` or `--parallel-files-download` according to the CPU limit set to the data mover pods.  

### Restart and resume
When Velero server is restarted, the running backups/restores will be marked as `Failed`. The corresponding `PodVolumeBackup`/`PodVolumeRestore` will be canceled.   
When node-agent is restarted, the controller will try to recapture and resume the `PodVolumeBackup`/`PodVolumeRestore`. If the resume fails, the `PodVolumeBackup`/`PodVolumeRestore` will be canceled.  

### Cancellation

At present, Velero backup and restore doesn't support end to end cancellation that is launched by users.  
However, Velero cancels the `PodVolumeBackup`/`PodVolumeRestore` in below scenarios automatically:
- When Velero server is restarted
- When node-agent is restarted and the resume fails  
- When an ongoing backup/restore is deleted
- When a backup/restore does not finish before the timeout (specified by Velero server parameter `fs-backup-timeout`, default value is `4 hours`)

## 3rd party controllers

### Monitor backup annotation

Velero does not provide a mechanism to detect persistent volume claims that are missing the File System Backup annotation.

To solve this, a controller was written by Thomann Bits&Beats: [velero-pvc-watcher][7]

## Support ReadOnlyRootFilesystem setting
When the Velero server/node-agent pod's SecurityContext sets the `ReadOnlyRootFileSystem` parameter to true, the Velero server/node-agent pod's filesystem is running in read-only mode.
If the user creates a backup with Kopia as the uploader, the backup will fail, because the Kopia needs to write some cache and configuration data into the pod filesystem.

```
Errors: Velero:    name: /mongodb-0 message: /Error backing up item error: /failed to wait BackupRepository: backup repository is not ready: error to connect to backup repo: error to connect repo with storage: error to connect to repository: unable to write config file: unable to create config directory: mkdir /home/cnb/udmrepo: read-only file system name: /mongodb-1 message: /Error backing up item error: /failed to wait BackupRepository: backup repository is not ready: error to connect to backup repo: error to connect repo with storage: error to connect to repository: unable to write config file: unable to create config directory: mkdir /home/cnb/udmrepo: read-only file system name: /mongodb-2 message: /Error backing up item error: /failed to wait BackupRepository: backup repository is not ready: error to connect to backup repo: error to connect repo with storage: error to connect to repository: unable to write config file: unable to create config directory: mkdir /home/cnb/udmrepo: read-only file system Cluster:    <none>
```

The workaround is making those directories as ephemeral k8s volumes, then those directories are not counted as pod's root filesystem.
The `user-name` is the Velero pod's running user name. The default value is `cnb`.

```  

## Priority Class Configuration

For Velero built-in data mover, data mover pods launched during file system backup will use the priority class name configured in the node-agent configmap. The node-agent daemonset itself gets its priority class from the `--node-agent-priority-class-name` flag during Velero installation. This can help ensure proper scheduling behavior in resource-constrained environments. For more details on configuring data mover pod resources, see [Data Movement Pod Resource Configuration][21].

## Resource Consumption

Both the uploader and repository consume remarkable CPU/memory during the backup/restore, especially for massive small files or large backup size cases.  
Velero node-agent uses [BestEffort as the QoS][14] for node-agent pods (so no CPU/memory request/limit is set), so that backups/restores wouldn't fail due to resource throttling in any cases.  
If you want to constraint the CPU/memory usage, you need to [customize the resource limits][15]. The CPU/memory consumption is always related to the scale of data to be backed up/restored, refer to [Performance Guidance][16] for more details, so it is highly recommended that you perform your own testing to find the best resource limits for your data.   

During the restore, the repository may also cache data/metadata so as to reduce the network footprint and speed up the restore. The repository uses its own policy to store and clean up the cache.  
For Kopia repository, by default, the cache is stored in the data mover pod's root file system. If your root file system space is limited, the data mover pods may be evicted due to running out of the ephemeral storage, which causes the restore fails. To cope with this problem, Velero allows you:
- configure a limit of the cache size per backup repository, for more details, check [Backup Repository Configuration][18].  
- configure a dedicated volume for cache data, for more details, check [Data Movement Cache Volume][22].  

## Restic Deprecation  

According to the [Velero Deprecation Policy][17], restic path is being deprecated starting from v1.15, specifically:
- For 1.15 and 1.16, if restic path is used by a backup, the backup still creates and succeeds but you will see warnings
- For 1.17 and 1.18, backups with restic path are disabled, but you are still allowed to restore from your previous restic backups
- From 1.19, both backups and restores with restic path will be disabled, you are not able to use 1.19 or higher to restore your restic backup data

From 1.17, backup from restic path is not allowed, though you can still restore from the existing backups created by restic path.  
Velero could automatically identify the legacy backups and switch to restic path without user intervention.  

### How Velero integrates with Restic
Velero integrate Restic binary directly, so the operations are done by calling Restic commands:
- Run `restic init` command to initialize the [restic repository](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/100_references.html#terminology)
- Run `restic prune` command periodically to prune restic repository
- Run `restic restore` commands to restore pod volume data

For a restore from restic path, restic commands are called by the node-agent itself; whereas, for kopia path backup/restore, the data path runs in the data mover pods.  
Restore from restic path is handled by the legacy `PodVolumeRestore` controller, so Resume and Cancellation are not supported:
- When Velero server is restarted, the legacy `PodVolumeRestore` is left as orphan and contineue running, though the restore has already marked as `Failed`
- When node-agent is restarted, the `PodVolumeRestore` is marked as `Failed` directly

### Restic Repository 
To support restic repository, the BackupRepository CR should be specially configured:
 - You need to set the `resticRepoPrefix` value in BackupStorageLocation. For example, on AWS, `resticRepoPrefix` is something like 
 `s3:s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bucket` (note that `resticRepoPrefix` doesn't work for Kopia).

Velero still effectively manage restic repository, though you cannot write any new backup to it:
- When you delete a backup, the restic repository snapshots (if any) could be deleted from restic repository
- Velero backup repository controller periodically runs mainteance jobs for BackupRepository CRs representing restic repositories

## Instructions

### Upgrade from v1.17
1. Install the Velero v1.18 command-line interface (CLI) by following the [instructions here][0].

    Verify that you've properly installed it by running:

    ```bash
    velero version --client-only
    ```

    You should see the following output:

    ```bash
    Client:
        Version: v1.18.0
        Git commit: <git SHA>
    ```

2. Update the Velero custom resource definitions (CRDs) to include schema changes across all CRDs that are at the core of the new features in this release:

    ```bash
    velero install --crds-only --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
    ```

3. Update the container image used by the Velero deployment, plugin and (optionally) the node agent daemon set:
    ```bash
   # set the container and image of the init container for plugin accordingly,
   # if you are using other plugin
    kubectl set image deployment/velero \
        velero=velero/velero:v1.18.0 \
        velero-plugin-for-aws=velero/velero-plugin-for-aws:v1.14.0 \
        --namespace velero

    # optional, if using the node agent daemonset
    kubectl set image daemonset/node-agent \
        node-agent=velero/velero:v1.18.0 \
        --namespace velero
    ```
4. Confirm that the deployment is up and running with the correct version by running:

    ```bash
    velero version
    ```

    You should see the following output:

    ```bash
    Client:
        Version: v1.18.0
        Git commit: <git SHA>

    Server:
        Version: v1.18.0
    ```

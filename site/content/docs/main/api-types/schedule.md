title: "Schedule API Type"
layout: docs

## Use

The `Schedule` API type is used as a repeatable request for the Velero server to perform a backup for a given cron notation. Once created, the
Velero Server will start the backup process. It will then wait for the next valid point of the given cron expression and execute the backup
process on a repeating basis.

## API GroupVersion

Schedule belongs to the API group version `velero.io/v1`.

## Definition

Here is a sample `Schedule` object with each of the fields documented:

```yaml
# Standard Kubernetes API Version declaration. Required.
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
# Standard Kubernetes Kind declaration. Required.
kind: Schedule
# Standard Kubernetes metadata. Required.
metadata:
  # Schedule name. May be any valid Kubernetes object name. Required.
  name: a
  # Schedule namespace. Must be the namespace of the Velero server. Required.
  namespace: velero
# Parameters about the scheduled backup. Required.
spec:
  # Paused specifies whether the schedule is paused or not
  paused: false
  # Schedule is a Cron expression defining when to run the Backup
  schedule: 0 7 * * *
  # Specifies whether to use OwnerReferences on backups created by this Schedule. 
  # Notice: if set to true, when schedule is deleted, backups will be deleted too. Optional.
  useOwnerReferencesInBackup: false
  # Template is the spec that should be used for each backup triggered by this schedule.
  template:
    # CSISnapshotTimeout specifies the time used to wait for
    # CSI VolumeSnapshot status turns to ReadyToUse during creation, before
    # returning error as timeout. The default value is 10 minute.
    csiSnapshotTimeout: 10m
    # resourcePolicy specifies the referenced resource policies that backup should follow
    # optional
    resourcePolicy:
      kind: configmap
      name: resource-policy-configmap
    # Array of namespaces to include in the scheduled backup. If unspecified, all namespaces are included.
    # Optional.
    includedNamespaces:
    - '*'
    # Array of namespaces to exclude from the scheduled backup. Optional.
    excludedNamespaces:
    - some-namespace
    # Array of resources to include in the scheduled backup. Resources may be shortcuts (for example 'po' for 'pods')
    # or fully-qualified. If unspecified, all resources are included. Optional.
    includedResources:
    - '*'
    # Array of resources to exclude from the scheduled backup. Resources may be shortcuts (for example 'po' for 'pods')
    # or fully-qualified. Optional.

    # Whether to include cluster-scoped resources. Valid values are true, false, and

    # resources and the label selector). If false, no cluster-scoped resources are included. If unset,
    # all cluster-scoped resources are included if and only if all namespaces are included and there are
    # no excluded namespaces. Otherwise, if there is at least one namespace specified in either
    # includedNamespaces or excludedNamespaces, then the only cluster-scoped resources that are backed
    # up are those associated with namespace-scoped resources included in the scheduled backup. For example, if a
    # PersistentVolumeClaim is included in the backup, its associated PersistentVolume (which is
    # cluster-scoped) would also be backed up.
    includeClusterResources: null

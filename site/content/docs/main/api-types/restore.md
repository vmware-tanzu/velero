## Use

The `Restore` API type is used as a request for the Velero server to perform a Restore. Once created, the
Velero Server immediately starts the Restore process.

## API GroupVersion

Restore belongs to the API group version `velero.io/v1`.

## Definition

Here is a sample `Restore` object with each of the fields documented:

```yaml
# Standard Kubernetes API Version declaration. Required.
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
# Standard Kubernetes Kind declaration. Required.
kind: Restore
# Standard Kubernetes metadata. Required.
metadata:
  # Restore name. May be any valid Kubernetes object name. Required.
  name: a-very-special-backup-0000111122223333
  # Restore namespace. Must be the namespace of the Velero server. Required.
  namespace: velero
# Parameters about the restore. Required.
spec:
  # The unique name of the Velero backup to restore from.
  backupName: a-very-special-backup
  # The unique name of the Velero schedule
  # to restore from. If specified, and BackupName is empty, Velero will
  # restore from the most recent successful backup created from this schedule.
  scheduleName: my-scheduled-backup-name
  # ItemOperationTimeout specifies the time used to wait for
  # asynchronous BackupItemAction operations
  # The default value is 1 hour.
  itemOperationTimeout: 1h
  # Array of namespaces to include in the restore. If unspecified, all namespaces are included.
  # Optional.
  includedNamespaces:
  - '*'
  # Array of namespaces to exclude from the restore. Optional.
  excludedNamespaces:
  - some-namespace
  # Array of resources to include in the restore. Resources may be shortcuts (for example 'po' for 'pods')
  # or fully-qualified. If unspecified, all resources are included. Optional.
  includedResources:
  - '*'
  # Array of resources to exclude from the restore. Resources may be shortcuts (for example 'po' for 'pods')
  # or fully-qualified. Optional.
  excludedResources:
  - storageclasses.storage.k8s.io

  # restoreStatus selects resources to restore not only the specification, but
  # the status of the manifest. This is specially useful for CRDs that maintain
  # external references. By default, it excludes all resources.
  restoreStatus:
    # Array of resources to include in the restore status. Just like above,
    # resources may be shortcuts (for example 'po' for 'pods') or fully-qualified.
    # If unspecified, no resources are included. Optional.
    includedResources:
    - workflows
    # Array of resources to exclude from the restore status. Resources may be
    # shortcuts (for example 'po' for 'pods') or fully-qualified.
    # If unspecified, all resources are excluded. Optional.
    excludedResources: []

  # Whether or not to include cluster-scoped resources. Valid values are true, false, and
  # null/unset. If true, all cluster-scoped resources are included (subject to included/excluded
  # resources and the label selector). If false, no cluster-scoped resources are included. If unset,
  # all cluster-scoped resources are included if and only if all namespaces are included and there are
  # no excluded namespaces. Otherwise, if there is at least one namespace specified in either
  # includedNamespaces or excludedNamespaces, then the only cluster-scoped resources that are backed
  # up are those associated with namespace-scoped resources included in the restore. For example, if a
  # PersistentVolumeClaim is included in the restore, its associated PersistentVolume (which is
  # cluster-scoped) would also be backed up.
  includeClusterResources: null
  # Individual objects must match this label selector to be included in the restore. Optional.
  labelSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: velero
      component: server
  # Individual object when matched with any of the label selector specified in the set are to be included in the restore. Optional.
  # orLabelSelectors as well as labelSelector cannot co-exist, only one of them can be specified in the restore request
  orLabelSelectors:
  - matchLabels:
      app: velero
  - matchLabels:
      app: data-protection
  # namespaceMapping is a map of source namespace names to
  # target namespace names to restore into. Any source namespaces not
  # included in the map will be restored into namespaces of the same name.
  namespaceMapping:
    namespace-backup-from: namespace-to-restore-to
  # restorePVs specifies whether to restore all included PVs
  # from snapshot. Optional
  restorePVs: true
  # preserveNodePorts specifies whether to restore old nodePorts from backup,
  # so that the exposed port numbers on the node will remain the same after restore. Optional
  preserveNodePorts: true
  # existingResourcePolicy specifies the restore behaviour
  # for the kubernetes resource to be restored. Optional
  existingResourcePolicy: none
  # Actions to perform during or post restore. The only hooks currently supported are
  # adding an init container to a pod before it can be restored and executing a command in a
  # restored pod's container. Optional.

    resources:
    # Name is the name of this hook.

      # namespaces. Optional.

      excludedNamespaces:
      - ns3
      # Array of resources to which this hook applies. If unspecified, the hook applies to all resources in the backup. Optional.
      # The only resource supported at this time is pods.

      # Array of resources to which this hook does not apply. Optional.
      excludedResources: []

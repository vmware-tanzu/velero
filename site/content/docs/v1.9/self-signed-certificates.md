title: "Use Velero with a storage provider secured by a self-signed certificate"
layout: docs
---

If you are using an S3-Compatible storage provider that is secured with a self-signed certificate, connections to the object store may fail with a `certificate signed by unknown authority` message.
To proceed, provide a certificate bundle when adding the storage provider.

## Trusting a self-signed certificate during installation

When using the `velero install` command, you can use the `--cacert` flag to provide a path
to a PEM-encoded certificate bundle to trust.

```bash
velero install \
    --plugins <PLUGIN_CONTAINER_IMAGE [PLUGIN_CONTAINER_IMAGE]>
    --provider <YOUR_PROVIDER> \
    --bucket <YOUR_BUCKET> \
    --secret-file <PATH_TO_FILE> \
    --cacert <PATH_TO_CA_BUNDLE>
```

Velero will then automatically use the provided CA bundle to verify TLS connections to
that storage provider when backing up and restoring.

## Trusting a self-signed certificate with the Velero client

To use the describe, download, or logs commands to access a backup or restore contained
in storage secured by a self-signed certificate as in the above example, you must use
the `--cacert` flag to provide a path to the certificate to be trusted.

```bash
velero backup describe my-backup --cacert <PATH_TO_CA_BUNDLE>
```

## Error with client certificate with custom S3 server

In case you are using a custom S3-compatible server, you may encounter that the backup fails with an error similar to one below.

```
rpc error: code = Unknown desc = RequestError: send request failed caused by:
Get https://minio.com:3000/k8s-backup-bucket?delimiter=%2F&list-type=2&prefix=: remote error: tls: alert(116)
```

Error 116 represents certificate required as seen here in [error codes](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446#appendix-B.2).
Velero as a client does not include its certificate while performing SSL handshake with the server.
From [TLS 1.3 spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446), verifying client certificate is optional on the server.
You will need to change this setting on the server to make it work.


## Skipping TLS verification

**Note:** The `--insecure-skip-tls-verify` flag is insecure and susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks and meant to help your testing and developing scenarios in an on-premise environment. Using this flag in production is not recommended.

Velero provides a way for you to skip TLS verification on the object store when using the [AWS provider plugin](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-aws) or [Restic](restic.md) by passing the `--insecure-skip-tls-verify` flag with the following Velero commands,

* velero backup describe
* velero backup download
* velero backup logs
* velero restore describe
* velero restore log

If true, the object store's TLS certificate will not be checked for validity before Velero connects to the object store or Restic repo. You can permanently skip TLS verification for an object store by setting `Spec.Config.InsecureSkipTLSVerify` to true in the [BackupStorageLocation](api-types/backupstoragelocation.md) CRD.

Note that Velero's Restic integration uses Restic commands to do data transfer between object store and Kubernetes cluster disks. This means that when you specify `--insecure-skip-tls-verify` in Velero operations that involve interacting with Restic, Velero will add the Restic global command parameter `--insecure-tls` to Restic commands.

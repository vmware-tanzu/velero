Velero provides best effort support through the process on this page for the current version of Velero and n-1 Velero version, including all patch releases in the supported minor releases. For example, if the current version is 1.9, the Velero maintainers would offer best effort support for v1.9 and v1.8. If you have a question about a previous Velero version (for example, 1.7), please note that maintainers may ask you to upgrade to a supported version before doing any investigation into your issue.

For more information about Velero testing and supported Kubernetes versions, see Velero's [compatibility matrix](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/blob/v1.14.0/README.md#velero-compatibility-matrix).


## Weekly Rotation

The Velero maintainers use a weekly rotation to manage community support. Each week, a different maintainer is the point person for responding to incoming support issues via Slack, GitHub, and the Google group. The point person is *not* expected to be on-call 24x7. Instead, they choose one or more hour(s) per day to be available/responding to incoming issues. They will communicate to the community what that time slot will be each week.

## Start of Week

We will update the public Slack channel's topic to indicate that you are the point person for the week, and what hours you'll be available.

## During the Week

### Where we will monitor
- `#velero-users` and `#velero-dev` public Slack channels in Kubernetes org
- [all Velero-related repos][0] in GitHub (`velero`, `velero-plugin-for-[aws|gcp|microsoft-azure|csi]`, `helm-charts`)

### GitHub issue flow

Generally speaking, new GitHub issues will fall into one of several categories. We use the following process for each:

1. **Feature request**
    - Label the issue with `kind/requirement` 
1. **Bug**
    - Label the issue with `Bug`
1. **User question/problem** that does not clearly fall into one of the previous categories
    - Add comments as you go, so both the user and future support people have as much context as possible
    - Use the `Needs investigation` label to indicate additional work needed to truly understand the problem or the root cause.
    - Use the `Needs Info` label to indicate an issue is waiting for information from the user. Remove/re-add the label as needed.
    - For the issues that require reproduction, add label `Needs reproduction` or `status/not-reproducible` to indicate the status.
    - If you resolve the issue with the user, close it out
    - If the issue ends up being a feature request or a bug, update the title and follow the appropriate process for it
    - If the reporter becomes unresponsive after multiple pings, close out the issue due to inactivity and comment that the user can always reach out again as needed

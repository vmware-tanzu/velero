## Use

Use the `Backup` API type to request the Velero server to perform a backup. Once created, the
Velero Server immediately starts the backup process.

## API GroupVersion

Backup belongs to the API group version `velero.io/v1`.

## Definition

Here is a sample `Backup` object with each of the fields documented:

```yaml
# Standard Kubernetes API Version declaration. Required.
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
# Standard Kubernetes Kind declaration. Required.
kind: Backup
# Standard Kubernetes metadata. Required.
metadata:
  # Backup name. May be any valid Kubernetes object name. Required.
  name: a
  # Backup namespace. Must be the namespace of the Velero server. Required.
  namespace: velero
# Parameters about the backup. Required.
spec:
  # CSISnapshotTimeout specifies the time used to wait for
  # CSI VolumeSnapshot status turns to ReadyToUse during creation, before
  # returning error as timeout. The default value is 10 minute.
  csiSnapshotTimeout: 10m
  # ItemOperationTimeout specifies the time used to wait for
  # asynchronous BackupItemAction operations
  # The default value is 1 hour.
  itemOperationTimeout: 1h
  # resourcePolicy specifies the referenced resource policies that backup should follow
  # optional
  resourcePolicy:
    kind: configmap
    name: resource-policy-configmap
  # Array of namespaces to include in the backup. If unspecified, all namespaces are included.
  # Optional.
  includedNamespaces:
  - '*'
  # Array of namespaces to exclude from the backup. Optional.
  excludedNamespaces:
  - some-namespace
  # Array of resources to include in the backup. Resources may be shortcuts (for example 'po' for 'pods')
  # or fully-qualified. If unspecified, all resources are included. Optional.
  includedResources:
  - '*'
  # Array of resources to exclude from the backup. Resources may be shortcuts (for example 'po' for 'pods')
  # or fully-qualified. Optional.
  excludedResources:
  - storageclasses.storage.k8s.io
  # Order of the resources to be collected during the backup process.  It's a map with key being the plural resource
  # name, and the value being a list of object names separated by comma.  Each resource name has format "namespace/objectname".
  # For cluster resources, simply use "objectname". Optional
  orderedResources:
    pods: mysql/mysql-cluster-replica-0,mysql/mysql-cluster-replica-1,mysql/mysql-cluster-source-0

  # Whether to include cluster-scoped resources. Valid values are true, false, and
  # null/unset. If true, all cluster-scoped resources are included (subject to included/excluded
  # resources and the label selector). If false, no cluster-scoped resources are included. If unset,
  # all cluster-scoped resources are included if and only if all namespaces are included and there are
  # no excluded namespaces. Otherwise, if there is at least one namespace specified in either
  # includedNamespaces or excludedNamespaces, then the only cluster-scoped resources that are backed
  # up are those associated with namespace-scoped resources included in the backup. For example, if a
  # PersistentVolumeClaim is included in the backup, its associated PersistentVolume (which is
  # cluster-scoped) would also be backed up.
  includeClusterResources: null
  # Array of cluster-scoped resources to exclude from the backup. Resources may be shortcuts 
  # (for example 'sc' for 'storageclasses'), or fully-qualified. If unspecified, 
  # no additional cluster-scoped resources are excluded. Optional.

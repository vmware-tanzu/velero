# The Metropolis Typeface

The Vision
---
To create a modern, geometric typeface. Open sourced, and openly available. Influenced by other popular geometric, minimalist sans-serif typefaces of the new millenium. Designed for optimal readability at small point sizes while beautiful at large point sizes.

December 2017 update
---
Currently working on greatly improving spacing and kerning of the base typeface. Once this is done, work on other variations (e.g. rounded or slab) can begin in earnest.

# Code Standards

## Adding a changelog

Authors are expected to include a changelog file with their pull requests. The changelog file
should be a new file created in the `changelogs/unreleased` folder. The file should follow the
naming convention of `pr-username` and the contents of the file should be your text for the
changelog.

    velero/changelogs/unreleased   <- folder
        000-username            <- file

Add that to the PR.

## Code

- Log messages are capitalized.

- Error messages are kept lower-cased.

- Wrap/add a stack only to errors that are being directly returned from non-velero code, such as an API call to the Kubernetes server.

    ```bash
    errors.WithStack(err)
    ```

- Prefer to use the utilities in the Kubernetes package [`sets`](https://godoc.org/github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/pkg/util/sets).

    ```bash
    k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/sets
    ```

## Imports

For imports, we use the following convention:

<group><version><api | client | informer | ...>

Example:

    import (
        corev1api "k8s.io/api/core/v1"
    	metav1 "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1"
    	corev1client "k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes/typed/core/v1"
    	corev1listers "k8s.io/client-go/listers/core/v1"
       
        velerov1api "github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/pkg/apis/velero/v1"
        velerov1client "github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/pkg/generated/clientset/versioned/typed/velero/v1"
    )

## Mocks

We use a package to generate mocks for our interfaces.

Example: if you want to change this mock: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/blob/v1.3.2/pkg/restic/mocks/restorer.go

Run:

```bash
go get github.com/vektra/mockery/.../
cd pkg/restic
mockery -name=Restorer
```

Might need to run `make update` to update the imports.

## DCO Sign off

All authors to the project retain copyright to their work. However, to ensure
that they are only submitting work that they have rights to, we are requiring
everyone to acknowledge this by signing their work.

To sign your work, just add a line like this at the end of your commit message:

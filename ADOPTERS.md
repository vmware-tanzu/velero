## Success Stories

Below is a list of adopters of Velero in **production environments** that have
publicly shared the details of how they use it.

**[BitGo][20]**  
BitGo uses Velero backup and restore capabilities to seamlessly provision and scale fullnode statefulsets on the fly as well as having it serve an integral piece for our kubernetes disaster-recovery story.

**[Bugsnag][30]**  
We use Velero for managing backups of an internal instance of our on-premise clustered solution. We also recommend our users of [on-premise Bugsnag installations][31] use Velero for [managing their own backups][32].

**[Banzai Cloud][60]**  
[Banzai Cloud Pipeline][61] is a Kubernetes-based microservices platform that integrates services needed for Day-1 and Day-2 operations along with first-class support both for on-prem and hybrid multi-cloud deployments. We use Velero to periodically [backup and restore these clusters in case of disasters][62].

## Solutions built with Velero

Below is a list of solutions where Velero is being used as a component.

**[Nirmata][10]**  
We have integrated our [solution with Velero][11] to provide our customers with out of box backup/DR.

**[Kyma][40]**  
Kyma [integrates with Velero][41] to effortlessly back up and restore Kyma clusters with all its resources. Velero capabilities allow Kyma users to define and run manual and scheduled backups in order to successfully handle a disaster-recovery scenario.

**[Red Hat][50]**  
Red Hat has developed the [Cluster Application Migration Tool][51] which uses [Velero and Restic][52] to drive the migration of applications between OpenShift clusters.

**[Dell EMC][70]**  
For Kubernetes environments, [PowerProtect Data Manager][71] leverages the Container Storage Interface (CSI) framework to take snapshots to back up the persistent data or the data that the application creates e.g. databases. [Dell EMC leverages Velero][72] to backup the namespace configuration files (also known as Namespace meta data) for enterprise grade data protection.

**[SIGHUP][80]**  
SIGHUP integrates Velero in its [Fury Kubernetes Distribution][81] providing predefined schedules and configurations to ensure an optimized disaster recovery experience.
[Fury Kubernetes Disaster Recovery Module][82] is ready to be deployed into any Kubernetes cluster running anywhere.

**[MayaData][90]**  
MayaData is a large user of Velero as well as a contributor. MayaData offers a Data Agility platform called [OpenEBS Director][91], that helps customers confidently and easily manage stateful workloads in Kubernetes. Velero is one of the core software building block of the OpenEBS Director's [DMaaS or data migration as a service offering][92] used to enable data protection strategies.

**[Okteto][93]**  
Okteto integrates Velero in [Okteto Cloud][94] and [Okteto Enterprise][95] to periodically backup and restore our clusters for disaster recovery. Velero is also a core software building block to provide namespace cloning capabilities, a feature that allows our users cloning staging environments into their personal development namespace for providing production-like development environments.

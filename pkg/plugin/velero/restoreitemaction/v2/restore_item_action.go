// RestoreItemAction is an actor that performs an operation on an individual item being restored.
type RestoreItemAction interface {
	// Name returns the name of this RIA. Plugins which implement this interface must define Name,
	// but its content is unimportant, as it won't actually be called via RPC. Velero's plugin infrastructure
	// will implement this directly rather than delegating to the RPC plugin in order to return the name
	// that the plugin was registered under. The plugins must implement the method to complete the interface.
	Name() string

	// AppliesTo returns information about which resources this action should be invoked for.
	// A RestoreItemAction's Execute function will only be invoked on items that match the returned
	// selector. A zero-valued ResourceSelector matches all resources.
	AppliesTo() (velero.ResourceSelector, error)

	// Execute allows the ItemAction to perform arbitrary logic with the item being restored,
	// including mutating the item itself prior to restore. The return struct includes:
	// The item (unmodified or modified), an optional slice of ResourceIdentifiers
	// specifying additional related items that should be restored, an optional OperationID,
	// a bool (waitForAdditionalItems) specifying whether Velero should wait until restored additional
	// items are ready before restoring this resource, and an optional timeout for the additional items
	// wait period. An error is returned if the action fails.
	Execute(input *velero.RestoreItemActionExecuteInput) (*velero.RestoreItemActionExecuteOutput, error)

	// Progress allows the RestoreItemAction to report on progress of an asynchronous action.
	// For the passed-in operation, the plugin will return an OperationProgress struct, indicating
	// whether the operation has completed, whether there were any errors, a plugin-specific
	// indication of how much of the operation is done (items completed out of items-to-complete),
	// and started/updated timestamps
	Progress(operationID string, restore *api.Restore) (velero.OperationProgress, error)

	// Cancel allows the RestoreItemAction to cancel an asynchronous action (if possible).
	// Velero will call this if the wait timeout for asynchronous actions has been reached.
	// If operation cancel is not supported, then the plugin just needs to return. No error
	// return is expected in this case, since cancellation is optional here.
	Cancel(operationID string, restore *api.Restore) error

	// AreAdditionalItemsReady allows the ItemAction to communicate whether the passed-in
	// slice of AdditionalItems (previously returned by Execute())
	// are ready. Returns true if all items are ready, and false
	// otherwise. The second return value is to report errors

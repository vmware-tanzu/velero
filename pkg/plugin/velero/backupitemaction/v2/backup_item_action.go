// BackupItemAction is an actor that performs an operation on an individual item being backed up.
type BackupItemAction interface {
	// Name returns the name of this BIA. Plugins which implement this interface must define Name,
	// but its content is unimportant, as it won't actually be called via RPC. Velero's plugin infrastructure
	// will implement this directly rather than delegating to the RPC plugin in order to return the name
	// that the plugin was registered under. The plugins must implement the method to complete the interface.
	Name() string

	// AppliesTo returns information about which resources this action should be invoked for.
	// A BackupItemAction's Execute function will only be invoked on items that match the returned
	// selector. A zero-valued ResourceSelector matches all resources.
	AppliesTo() (velero.ResourceSelector, error)

	// Execute allows the BackupItemAction to perform arbitrary logic with the item being backed up,
	// including mutating the item itself prior to backup. The item (unmodified or modified)
	// should be returned, along with an optional slice of ResourceIdentifiers specifying
	// additional related items that should be backed up now, an optional operationID for actions which
	// initiate (asynchronous) operations, and a second slice of ResourceIdentifiers specifying related items
	// which should be backed up after all operations have completed. This last field will be
	// ignored if operationID is empty, and should not be filled in unless the resource must be updated in the
	// backup after operations complete (i.e. some of the item's kubernetes metadata will be updated
	// during the operation which will be required during restore)
	// Note that (async) operations are not supported for items being backed up during Finalize phases,
	// so a plugin should not return an OperationID if the backup phase is "Finalizing"
	// or "FinalizingPartiallyFailed". The plugin should check the incoming
	// backup.Status.Phase before initiating operations, since the backup has already passed the waiting
	// for plugin operations phase. Plugins being called during Finalize will only be called for resources
	// that were returned as postOperationItems.

	// Progress allows the BackupItemAction to report on progress of an asynchronous action.
	// For the passed-in operation, the plugin will return an OperationProgress struct, indicating
	// whether the operation has completed, whether there were any errors, a plugin-specific
	// indication of how much of the operation is done (items completed out of items-to-complete),
	// and started/updated timestamps
	Progress(operationID string, backup *api.Backup) (velero.OperationProgress, error)

	// Cancel allows the BackupItemAction to cancel an asynchronous action (if possible).
	// Velero will call this if the wait timeout for asynchronous actions has been reached.
	// If operation cancel is not supported, then the plugin just needs to return. No error
	// return is expected in this case, since cancellation is optional here.
